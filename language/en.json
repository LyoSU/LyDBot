I would have finished on this one, but no.\n➖ Advanced search. Will find a song even based on its lyrics.\n➖ Quality music database. Without any remixes or microphone recordings.\n➖ Original quality of sent files. AAC 128 Kbps.\n➖ Each audio is being sent with an original album cover.\n\n❕I send audio instantly if it has already been downloaded through me earlier. Otherwise, the download usually takes no more than 10 seconds.\n\n🗄 Downloaded audio I store in <a href=\"https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEpNIFaaE_CgT1vTYQ\">my channel</a>.\n<b>👨🏻‍💻Devblog (in Russian):</b> @LyBlog\n\n Translated by @z33ga",
